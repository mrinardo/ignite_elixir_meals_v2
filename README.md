# Meals

This Phoenix REST API application exposes CRUD methods to manage the meals of the day. Data is stored in a Postgres database.

This is [challenge #1](https://www.notion.so/Desafio-01-Relacionamento-de-entidades-a3f4e684eefa493c97e7bb3f51c04989) of Rocketseat's Ignite Elixir module 5.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Tests

You can also run the tests script in the terminal (outside `iex`):

```shell
$ mix test
$ mix test --cover
```
